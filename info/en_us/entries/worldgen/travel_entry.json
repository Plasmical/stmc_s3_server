Of course, travel is still faster (at a 8:1 ratio), but the Nether roof is no longer available because of the world build limit. Terrain is also much harder to traverse, so it's overall a poor idea to rely on the Nether for travel."

All tools and armor can give speed boosts at higher tiers, along with other status improvements. These tiers are random whenever acquiring the gear, but can be reforged in anvils with amethyst and the gear material."
