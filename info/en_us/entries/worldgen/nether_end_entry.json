Because of the new world height, structures are often above/below you. Some biomes have been renamed, but they are all the same still. Sulfur is also a new ore that allows for crafting gunpowder."

However, the scale of the world and the lack of new useful structures make the end progression and traversal feel very similar to vanilla."
